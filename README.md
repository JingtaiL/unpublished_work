### Does training on higher cognitive functions change patterns of brain connectivity at rest during middle childhood?

**Abstract**: Cognitive training can improve performance on trained abilities, 
and this effect can be also transferred to untrained capacities. 
However, the neural mechanisms supporting these behavioral improvements 
due to training are still unclear. The present study was aimed at investigating whether 
training school-aged children in cognitive control and attention could alter their 
involved intrinsic functional networks, and to what extent these effects can be generalized 
to untrained reading abilities and their brain networks. A total of 41 children (8-10 years old) 
underwent MRI scanning before and after being assigned to either training sessions involving games 
of increasing difficulty (Experimental, n = 20) or training sessions where children just 
played lower levels of difficulty of the same games (Control, n = 21). The two groups were 
carefully matched on age, gender and intelligence. After 2-3 weeks of training, 
the task-related networks showed important changes in terms of increasing and 
decreasing functional connectivity patterns in the Experimental group. 
Observed connection changes in cognitive control and attention were mainly concentrated on 
fronto-parietal networks. In contrast, changes in reading task were mainly emerged 
between parietal and temporal regions. These results not only provided strong evidence 
to support the view of neural plasticity on large-scale networks during middle childhood, 
but also direct neuroimaging evidence for the transfer effects of cognitive training.
